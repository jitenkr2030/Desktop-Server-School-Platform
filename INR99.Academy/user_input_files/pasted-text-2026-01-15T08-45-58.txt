Summary of Critical Gaps














































Priority	Gap	Impact
HIGH	Appeals process	Institutions cannot contest rejections
HIGH	Tier transition logic	Cannot move institutions between tiers
MEDIUM	Support tier routing	No differentiated support by tier
MEDIUM	Feature allocation
	No tier-based feature restrictions
MEDIUM	Account management	No health scoring or proactive outreach
LOW	Domain verification	Incomplete identity verification
LOW	Revenue integration	No foundation for future monetization

Recommended Next Steps

    1.Immediate Priority: Implement the appeals process to provide institutions with recourse for rejections
    2.Second Priority: Complete tier transition logic and feature allocation system
    3.Third Priority: Implement support tier routing and account management workflows
    4.Fourth Priority: Enhance third-party integrations with real API connections

I'll continue implementing the Tier Transition and Feature Allocation system by creating the API endpoints, feature flags, access control logic, and the tenant tier UI page.

Let me create these files:
